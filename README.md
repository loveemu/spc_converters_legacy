SNES MIDI Converters
====================

These MIDI converters are somewhat old and do not have 100% accuracy.
The source code is extremely messy and it is hard to read!

Currently, I am trying to implement those converter functions into [VGMTrans](https://github.com/vgmtrans/vgmtrans), in more beautiful manner and improved accuracy.

Disassembly codes has been moved to <https://github.com/loveemu/vgm-disasm>.
