SNES MIDI Converters
====================
[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/loveemu/spc_converters_legacy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/loveemu/spc_converters_legacy) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/tu8kkqss0eevukqq/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/loveemu/spc_converters_legacy/branch/master)

These MIDI converters are somewhat old and do not have 100% accuracy.
The source code is extremely messy and it is hard to read!

Currently, I am trying to implement those converter functions into [VGMTrans](https://github.com/vgmtrans/vgmtrans), in more beautiful manner and improved accuracy.

Disassembly codes has been moved to <https://github.com/loveemu/vgm-disasm>.
